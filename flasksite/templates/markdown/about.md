#### The Kingfisher Cafe

The Kingfisher cafe for the Homeless is based in Bridlington and looks after the homeless and needy in our area.

We provide a safe, warm and friendly cafe which is centrally located. There are currently no staff costs as the cafe is completely run by volunteers, some of whom have been homeless in the past and have previously benefited from the food and support provided by our Charity. We are grateful for food donations from our local supermarkets, since our monthly running costs are over £1,200.

We work together with the local churches and other agencies and we provide clothing, sleeping bags, toiletries and other necessities. We co-operate with the local police, probation office and the council. We also have very good relationships with the local community and businesses who all make donations.

We provide:
- breakfast on four days per week
- hot evening meals on three nights per week and a Sunday lunch
- a 'pack-up' of a sandwich with either fruit, biscuit or cake
- a flask of tea or coffee

60 meals are provided each week for 52 weeks per year. We therefore source, prepare and serve approximately 3,000 meals per year.

We improve the lives of our beneficiaries through our support with completing forms and job applications, passing on donated clothes and household goods, linking with other support agencies, allowing them to claim benefits through the use of our address and staying in contact with their families.
